# GenAI-powered-nuclear-ms

A novel GenAI-driven paradigm for nuclear M&S: an intelligent orchestration layer that coordinates tool-using agents + multimodal knowledge retrieval for automated workflows and traceable decision support for engineers (human-in-the-loop, 3S-aligned).

## What this repository contains

This repository serves as the **public companion hub** for the GenAI-powered nuclear modeling & simulation methodology developed in my PhD thesis work. It hosts **high-resolution figures**, **interactive HTML visualizations**, **public-facing documentation**, and other thesis materials suitable for public dissemination.

> **Note:** Source code is intentionally kept out of this repository and maintained in specialized repositories (linked below).

### Nuclear M&S “Generations” paradigm
- We propose a **GenAI-driven Generation III** layer above Generation I (standalone codes) and Generation II (integrated multi-physics frameworks).
- The hypothesis is that **tool-using agents + multimodal retrieval** can act as an *orchestration layer* over existing solvers—automating input preparation, execution, post-processing, reporting, and knowledge lookup.
- This can reduce workflow friction, improve traceability/reproducibility, and strengthen human-in-the-loop decision support as integrated workflows scale.
