# GenAI-powered-nuclear-ms

A novel GenAI-driven paradigm for nuclear M&S: an intelligent orchestration layer that coordinates tool-using agents + multimodal knowledge retrieval for automated workflows and traceable decision support for engineers (human-in-the-loop, 3S-aligned).

## What this repository contains

This repository serves as the **public companion hub** for the GenAI-powered nuclear modeling & simulation methodology developed in my PhD thesis work. It hosts **high-resolution figures**, **interactive HTML visualizations**, **public-facing documentation**, and other thesis materials suitable for public dissemination.

> **Note:** Source code is intentionally kept out of this repository and maintained in specialized repositories (linked below).

### Nuclear M&S “Generations” paradigm (draft)
A first-draft visualization proposing a **GenAI-driven Generation III** layer on top of Generation I (standalone codes) and Generation II (integrated multi-physics frameworks). We posit that the field is entering a transition in which GenAI-enabled, tool-using agents and multimodal knowledge retrieval may act as an ``orchestration layer'' above existing simulation codes and integrated frameworks. In this view, Generation III does not replace Generation I/II physics solvers; rather, it augments them by reducing workflow friction (setup, coupling, debugging, post-processing), improving traceability and reproducibility, and enabling human-in-the-loop decision support. As these orchestration capabilities mature, the integrated workflows may expand rapidly, filling gaps that have historically been limited by integration overhead and operational complexity.
